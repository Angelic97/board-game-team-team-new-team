# User stories

Use this template when writing the user stories:

"As a user, I want to click a button so that I can pick my color."
"As a user, I want to roll a dice so that I can see who goes first"
"As a user, I want to roll a dice so that I can make my move"
"As a user, I want to select which piece to move"

Create a new Markdown file for each userstory and create a toc.yml in the userstories folder, and add each userstory to the TOC (table of content).
